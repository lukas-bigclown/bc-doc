== What is it?

With this setup you will be able to monitor environmental conditions in your workroom.
Project will periodically measure relative humidity and temperature.
If one of these values are out of proper range, project will indicate it on a programmable LED strip by a change of color.

The color codes are as following:

* The color is green if the humidity is too high (> 60%).
* The color is yellow if the humidity is too low (< 30%).
* The color is red if the temperature is too high (> 26°C).
* The color is blue if the temperature is too low (< 22°C).

Any of these limit values can be adjusted in configuration (later we will show you how).
Besides this primary function the project may also serve as a pleasant lighting on your desk or can be modified for other purposes.

Workroom project consists of two units described below.


=== Base unit

This unit is responsible for driving of the LED strip and receiving wireless data from Remote unit.
Wireless data are dispatched from Base unit to Raspberry Pi which decides about the color of the connected LED strip.


=== Remote unit

Remote unit is a battery-operated wireless node measuring temperature and humidity and transmitting these data to Base unit in regular 30-second intervals.

The whole concept is best described by the following diagram:

. *Transmit pairing signal on Remote unit* +
  Press and hold BOOT button on Core Module of Remote unit until red LED on Core Module lights up for two seconds.
  BOOT button is marked on Core Module with letter "B".
  Now pairing signal has been sent and Remote unit should stop blinking.
+

+
. *Turn on the light* +
  Shortly press BOOT button either on Base unit or Remote unit to turn on the light.
  You can use this button any time you will want to turn the LED strip on or off.

== MQTT data playground

All messages between Linux components in the system are exchanged via MQTT broker.
MQTT broker is the heart of BigClown home automation system.

You can find more about MQTT here:

* link:../academy/mqtt.html[MQTT - Messaging via Broker]
* link:../tutorial/mosquitto.html[Mosquitto - MQTT Broker]

How-to communicate with MQTT broker:

. Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH (port 22) using:
*  Windows: Use http://www.putty.org[PuTTY]
*  Linux + macOS: Use ssh command in Terminal

. Default username is "pi" and password "raspberry"

. Show measurements from remote (reported every 30 seconds):
+
 mosquitto_sub -v -t "nodes/remote/#"

TIP: Use Ctrl-C to stop measurements monitoring.

[start=4]
. Use LED strip as light and set luminosity:
+ 
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"state": "color", "color": [0, 0, 0, 128]}'

. Update and retain LED strip brightness:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" '{"brightness": 100}' -r

IMPORTANT: Notice *-r* to store topic in MQTT broker as persistent configuration

[start=6]
. Use LED strip as humidity and temperature indicator:
+ 
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"state": "rules"}'


=== Sensors on remote

* Measured temperature and humidity values reported by Remote unit
+
 nodes/remote/thermometer/i2c0-49 {"temperature": [23.62, "\u2103"]}
 nodes/remote/humidity-sensor/i2c0-40 {"relative-humidity": [33.2, "%"]}


=== Relay on base

* Relay has state true (switched on) or false (switched off)
+
 nodes/base/relay/- {"state": true}

==== Examples

* Switch Relay ON
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/relay/-/set" -m '{"state": true}' 

* Switch Relay OFF
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/relay/-/set" -m '{"state": false}' 

* Request Relay state
+
 mosquitto_sub -v -t "nodes/base/relay/-" &
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/relay/-/get" -m '{}' 


=== LED strip on base

* Desired color of the LED strip connected to Base unit
+
  nodes/base/led-strip/-/set {"pixels": "/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA/wAAAP8AAAD/AAAA"}

* LED strip configuration
+
 nodes/base/led-strip/-/config/set {"mode": "rgb", "count": 150}
 nodes/base/led-strip/-/config/set {"mode": "rgbw", "count": 144}

=== Plugin led-strip

Temperature and humididy limits are evaluated by Python script running on Raspberry Pi in Linux (we use Raspbian as the official Linux distribution).

Plugin serves also as comfort driver for LED strip.

* Generate data for all pixels through color attribute:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"color": [255,0,0,0]}'

* Use data/set color attribute to generate pixels:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"state": "color"}'

* Use rules matching to generate pixels:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"state": "rules"}'

==== Examples
* Use LED strip as light
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" -m '{"state": "color", "color": [0, 0, 0, 255]}], "brightness": 200}'

* Change LED strip brightness:
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/data/set" '{"brightness": 100}'

* Switch LED strip OFF
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/light/-/set" -m '{"state": false}' 

* Switch LED strip ON
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/light/-/set" -m '{"state": true}' 

NOTE: Pixels are preserved.

* Request LED strip state
+
 mosquitto_sub -v -t "nodes/base/light/-" & 
 mosquitto_pub -t "nodes/base/light/-/get" -m '{}' 
 nodes/base/light/- {"state": true}


==== Change default thresholds

Everybody likes different environment so the preset thresholds for temperature and humidity might not be optimal for you.

* Change the rules (first matching rule is used to set color):
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/led-strip/config" -m '{
  "rules": [
      {"relative-humidity": {"from": 60}, "color": [0, 255, 0, 0]},
      {"relative-humidity": {"to": 30}, "color": [255, 255, 0, 0]},
      {"temperature": {"from":30}, "color": [255, 0, 0, 0]},
      {"temperature": {"to": 22}, "color": [0, 0, 255, 0]},
      {"color": [0, 0, 0, 255]},
  ]
 }' -r

=== Plugin blynk

JavaScript integration plugin with http://www.blynk.cc/[Blynk]

* Configure Blynk token for virtual HW
+
 mosquitto_pub -t "plugin/blynk/config" -m '{"token":"ec9fdfdf0c7d49bcae3e83be3dceb4c1"}' -r
